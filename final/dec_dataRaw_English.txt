 You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believethiswill change your mind. In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of...continued on page 153...sucking.
 Maybe.
 You and me both.
 OK, I'll see you later babe.
 Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
 And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
 Really? I only had two glasses.
 So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
 Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
 Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
  Mmmm, no.
 You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
 Bobby.
 Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
 So, what are you saying now?
 Hey.
  You have other friends?
 What?
 What are you talking about?
 It's Fun Bobby.
 Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
 Alright, here you go, sweetie. 
 Oh God, yes!
 Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
 Oh.... my... God.
 Not that bad? Did youhearthe hammer story?
 But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
 She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
 See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
 Bye.
 Do you not see it?
 Yes, I would like something.  No, no thank you.
 No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it.  Just some water.
  I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
 Morning.
 Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
 Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
 Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
 Sure.
 Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
 What about me?
 What these?  Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
 Oh... shoot.
 OK.
 Take care.
 Well we... we kinda broke up.
  Does anybody want these?
 Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
 Ok.
 Oh, you and me?
 Ok.
 As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
 Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
 No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
 Mmm hmmm.
 Uh-huh.
 This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
 Would it matter?
 I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
 If you wanna call that a reason.
 Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
 Excellent!
 That is so good! Do it again!
 No no, that's me.
 Oh, hello.
 Is everything ok?
 Oh my god.
 Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
 Hi, Mrs. Green.
 And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
 No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
 What's the matter?
 What?
 Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
 Oh my god.
 It's ok. I'm sorry.
 I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
 Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
 Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
 Any time.
 Yeah, can't help but.
 Ok.
 Yeah.
 No, that's fine.
 Ok.
 Well, Mon, I was married.
 Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
 Rhythm?
 You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
 Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. 
 Hello.
  Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
 The one time they're not home.
 That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Well, you remember Cathy Bates inMisery?
 Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
 Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
 Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
 Very informative!
 That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
 And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. 
 What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
  So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
  Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
 Ahhhh.
 Uh, yes, yes it is.
 Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
 Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
 Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
 Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
 No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
 OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
 Oh uh, o, OK.
 Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
 No one was around to hear that?
 Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
 Like, when you're cooking a steak.
 Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
 OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
 I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
 Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
 Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
 Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
 You want me to wear your panties?
 Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
 I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
 Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
 Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa  They do have the shrimp.
 I'm going to the bathroom now. 
 I can't believe we're doing this.
 Alrighty. 
 What?
 Oh.
 OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
 Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
 OK.
 Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
 Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
 What, what's what you mean?
 That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
 Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
 Joey?
 Joey!
 Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
 Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
 No, no, this is the first time.
 I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
 No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
 No, no, you don't have to see.
 Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
 How can you not be wearing any underwear?
 Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
 Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
 How long you been waitin' to say that?
 Great.
 Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
 A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
 You got it.
 Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
 Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
 That's your call.
 Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
 They'r alright.
 No really, they're OK.
 Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
 I'm outa here. 
 Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
 Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
 No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
 Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
 Hi.
 So, what's this.
 Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
 Oh, God forbid.
 Where have you been?
 No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
 Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
 Because they made me.
 Anything larger back there?
 You have dinosaur checks?
 Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
 Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
 Hey, you got me, put it in.
 You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
 Over here dad. 
 Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
 Oh, you look so great.
 Oops.
 Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
 Oh, dad, turn it off.
 Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
 Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
 I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
 If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
 I can't believe you did that.
 Mom, I'm hungry.
 Alright.
 This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
 Hey you. 
 Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
 Bye guys.
 I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
 It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
 Oh.
 Mon.
 Mon.
 What, what.
 And that's, that's funny why?
 I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
 OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
 No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
 Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
 That's romantic.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 That was 14 hours ago.
 Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
 Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
 Hey.
 No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
 Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
 Hey.
 Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
 Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
 Well, why're you all dressed up?
 What? You have a date? Who with?
 C'mon, what's his name?
 Come on, tell me.
 Oh, I promise, what.
 Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
 Doctor Burke is sexy?
  It's the museum again, can I, oh.
  Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
 Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
 KARL!
 Rach.
 I'm done.
 Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
 No, no, we won't.
  C'mon.
 Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
  OK, now, sit. OK. 
 Sorry.
 Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
 I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
 You're not laughing.
 What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
 Hi.
 I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
 We're not alone. 
 What?
 Yeah, so.
 Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
 Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
 Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
 Hey.
 Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
 Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
 So where you gettin' it?
 Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
 Can you believe this place?
 Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
 Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
 Huh?
 Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
 Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
 Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
 Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
 I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
 What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
 Well that's how I feel.
 Well then maybe I will.
 Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
 Hey.
 Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
 I know. Yeah.
 No, we're alright.
 Plastic spoons. Great.
 These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
 Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
 I'm movin' out like we talked about.
 Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
 Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
 Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
 Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
 Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
 Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
 Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
 Yes! And the table is mine.
 Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
 Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
 Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
 So, I guess this is it.
 Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
 Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
  Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
 Art it is.
 Joey, promise me something.
 Never call me from that phone.
 Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
 Blow drying what, you have no hair.
 Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
 GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
 I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
 Shut up.
 Cut it out.
 But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
 I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
 Iwas.
 Did she leave a number?
 I don't have her number, butt-munch.
 I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
 You wanna get out of my face?
 Give me that.
 Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. 
 I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
 I wanna watchEntertainment Tonight.
 It's my TV.
 Bite me.
 Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
 OK, what're we gonna do about this?
 Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
 I just can't stand you being here all the time.
 Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
 Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
 Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
 Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
 Duh-huh!
 Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
 Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
 Then I won't have to kill you.
 Yeah, thanks. You know what?
 If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
 So what're you gonna do?
 Sure.
 They won't take you to the vet.
 Joey.
 God that is good TV.
 Phoebs, play with meeee.
 Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
 Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
 No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
 We don't need to remedy that.
 That was so lame.
 So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
 What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
 Well it's not Sean Penn.
 Hi.
 Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
 Oh, oh, c'mon in.
 Oh.
 Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
 Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
 Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
 Bye.
 So, we gettin' a fish?
 Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
 This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
 Buddy?
 There was no fish when she dropped it off.
 Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? 
 So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
 Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
 Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
 Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
 We're worried about you.
 We came over as soon as we saw.
 It's gonna be ok. You know that?
 I'm sorry man.
 Uhhhaahh.
 Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
  Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
  Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
 Ok, good night.  You big freak of nature.
 Hey.
 Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
 Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
 Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray onDays of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
 Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
 Anybody want a croan.
 So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
 No, can we get back to me?
 Alright. Cab driver number two?
 But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
 But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
 I'm sorry. See ya.
 What is it?
 See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
 It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
 Oh my God.
 Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
 Ahh.
 My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
 What?
 That's a two line part.
 So what.
 Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
 Yeah.
 Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
 Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
 Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
 Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
 Well don't just say.
 Ok.
 I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
 Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
 Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
 I fell down an elevator shaft.
 What?
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
 What?
 Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was onDays of Our Livesas Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
 And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
 No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish.Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge.You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. 
 Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
 They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
 Thanks Ross.
 I went.
 I didn't get it.
 What?
 Huh?
  Oh, not my parrot.
 I can't watch this.
 Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
 Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
 Hello.
 I know I would.
 Hey no problem.
 Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
 A little foos?
 What happened to the foosball?
 He paid a lot of money for it.
 Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
 What're you talkin' about?
 Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
  No no, you're fine, you're fine.
 Hi.
 Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
 Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
 I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
 Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
 Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
 Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
 Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
 Buy mommy.
 Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
 Yeah.
 Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
 Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
 Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
 Thank you.
 Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
 Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
 What're you doing?
 Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
 Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
 Ok, here, here. There we go.
 It's alright, it's no big deal.
 Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
 What?
 Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
 Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
 Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
 Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
 Huh?
  Ok, what the hell happened back there?
 Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
 C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
 No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
 The big book of childrens' names.
 Yeah.
 Ok fine.
 We're not done.
 Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
 Good, 'cause I love you.
 Yeah.
 Well that's the first time we've said that.
 Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
 Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
  Hello.
 Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. 
 Wha, what?
 What, the word hi?
 Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
 Something about hi.
 Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
 Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
 Bye Ben.
 Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
 No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
 And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
 No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
 Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
 Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
 Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
 Thanks. 
  Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
 No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
 Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap.  Ok, alright, we have a problem.
 Are you crazy?
 Yeah, I don't know.
 I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
 Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
  What was that?
  Hey.
 Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
 Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
 I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
 Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. 
 So talk to her.
 Hi.
 It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
 Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
 Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
 Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
 Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
 Ok so will he be back soon?
 Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
 Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
 Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
 Oh.
 Stilts?
 Wow.
 I don't know what to do with that.
 Yeah.
 I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
 That'll work too.
 Yeah, that'd be ok.
 Ok, I'm in the book.
 Alright. So um, stilts huh?
 Ok.
 Hey nice boobs.
 What?
 You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
 Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
 Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See  honk honk.
 Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
 Joey that is horriable.
 So what happened?
 Well, how bout just her mom?
 Cause I already invited her.
 Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
 It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
  Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
 No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
 No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
 Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
 Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
 Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
 So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
 Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
 Chandler could you at least send some women to my party?  Alright that's Ross.
 Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
 Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
 Just go.
 Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
 Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.  Gunther, where're you going?
 No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
 Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
 What?  I don't see anything.
 Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
 You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
 Phoebe.
 Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... 
 Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
 Ok will do. So glad you came.
 Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
 Thank you.
 Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
 Ok, that's enough.
 Oh, I ordered mine first.
 Give it to me.
 Give it to me.
  There you go, enjoy your coffee.
  Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
 That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
 Had it.
 Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
 Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
 Just waiting for you sweetie.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
 If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
 Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
 I'm just easing you in.
 Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
 Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
 You look fabulous honey, you really do.
 It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
 This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
 It's for their own good.
 Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
 Very good.
 You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
 I'm gonna set them to my time.
 No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
 No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
 No. See you don't understand.
 No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
 Oh yeah.
 Alright, well tell me one of yours.
 What if they get mixed up?
 You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
 What's up?
 Yeah?
 No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
 No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
 Alright, go on.
 Oh my God, you're a freak.
 Yeah, right.
 I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
 Because I promised Mindy I would.
 Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
 Nooo!
 Wow! What's that like?
 Afraid to ask him?
 Hey!
 Hi.
 Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
 God I know, you're right.
 Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
 Thank you, Okay, Okay.
 Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
 Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
 Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
 Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
 Oh, hi!
 I know.
 Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
 Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
 Insane!
 What?!
 What.
 Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
 Oh dear God.
  She you in the parking lot.
  Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I
  "...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
 At the Copa, Copa Cabana  The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
 Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. 
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
What?
 Bob here.
 What've you been up to?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
 I'm back.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this 
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
But it's Ross.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
You know, I think I might just.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
We don't know Bob! Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
All right. 
Hi.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
I don't know.  I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? 
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Yes, how 'bout a verse ofKilling Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
 Okay.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
You can tell us.
We can talk about that.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Together.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
 By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!  The Blowfish!
If you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
 Why did you look at me when you said that?
Fine. 
 Yeah?
Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
 Bob here.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
So, uh, how was he?
Eh?
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
So, let's go.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
 Chandler.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Yes, apparently Stevie and Hootie are like this. 
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yes.
No.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Can I uh see something? 
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.  Joey, she does not look fat.
Oh hey Monica. 
Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
You understood that?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
No, I got him.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Well, we are great guys.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
 Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Wait-wait-wait-wait!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
 You done?
You know it?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
 Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.  Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.
That's me.
Actually, uh, we're both the father. 
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Ok.
Yeah?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads it is.
We have to assign heads to something.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
 Hey, he's not crying.
You, you are gonna love this.
 Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
 So, how was the party?
 Hey Pheebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
 Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
 What?  C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
 Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
 Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
 Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
 Together?
 Both of you?
 Together.
 Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
 Well.  Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, Okay, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat.  Okay, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
  How long do cats live?
 Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
 That's just great. 
 Oh, right, clink. 
 Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
 I mean he just started going out with her.
 Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.
 Okay, Okay. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
  I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's acat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruit flies, those things that live for like a day or something?  What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
 Yes! Thank you.
 Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
 Oh, Look at me, Look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
 Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
 Closure, that's what it is. Closure.  Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, helwoo 
 Hello, excuse me.
 Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
 I can see that. Ijust one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself.  Okay, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
 Thank you. Okay.   Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
  Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. 
 Ahhhh.
 Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
 I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
 Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
 Huh.
 Oh yeah, go ahead. 
 Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . 
 Ohhhhhhhh God. 
 Ohh, ohh.
 Ohh, Okay, Okay, Okay, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
 Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
 Chandler told me.
 When you were in China.
 Meeting Julie.
 Are you over me?
 Wait, so, you're going?
 Okay, Okay.
 Hi.
 Oh, that's um, interesting.
 All right, I got it Ross.
  What?
 Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
 I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
 Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
 Hey, there was one Italian guy, Okay, and do you even have a point?
 Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
 All right, fine, you go ahead and you do that, all right Ross.
 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
 Good. 
 And ya know what, now I've got closure.
 And, uh, and then I kissed her.
 Yeah.
 Hi.
 That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
 Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
 Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
 How are you?
 Good.
 Hi, Julie.  Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
  Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
  Play it.
  Ssshh.
 I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
 Can't we just use a pen?
 I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
 And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
 I don't know.
  She's not Rachel.
 Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
 Hi.
 I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
 No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
 Well, uh.
 Really. It's always been you, Rach.
 I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
 Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
 Hey, someone order a coat?
 He won't?  He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
 No!
 That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
 No, you don't.
 Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
 Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
 No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
 No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
 No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
 Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
 I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
  Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
 Number six: the way you smell.
 Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
 I am, uh, I am...
 Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
 No?
 Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
 No, but, but I wanna be with you inspiteof all those things.
 You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
 Hi.
 Look, can, can you do something for me?
 I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
 Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
 Hey.
 Happy Christmas Eve Eve.  Oh my God, where did you get this?
 This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
 No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
 No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
  OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
 It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. 
 Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
 Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
 Just, you know, to see... um.
 OK, is this really my father?
 OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
 Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
 Oh God.
 Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
 OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
  Oh.
 Oh.
 Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. 
 Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
 Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
 No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
 Whattaya mean?
 Wow. Thank you.
 Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! 
 Hey.
 Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
 OK, let's go.
 Alright, here, you have to hold this. 
 Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
 Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. 
 Ooh, this is it, 74. 
 Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
 OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
 OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. 
 OK.
 Mailbox.
 Uh-huh.
 No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
 Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
 Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
 Yeah?
 You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
 Oh, I couldn't go in.
 Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
 Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
 You guuuyys.
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache. 
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Well, Im gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think shell like?
All right, see you guys. 
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Yeah.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?
 And what is second prize?
Well, that makes sense.
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Hi, Im selling Brown Bird cookies.
No, hi, Im, Im an honorary Brown Bird 
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but Im not invited to sleep-overs.
No, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Okay, okay! Im going. Im going. 
All right!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Mon?
Ah, no Mon, Dadhadto buy everyone of your boxesbecauseyou ate them all. But ah, y'know Im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why dont I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolphs.
Oh, come on, now you know you want em.
Ill tell you what Mon, Ill give you the first box for free.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating em! 
Ah, were out. I sold them all.
Monica, Im cutting you off.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Well you sure used a large font.
Sweetie, calm down, its gonna be okay.
What, that wasnt the great news?
 Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Whats a scrud?
I dont have too. I can just look at you.
 Not nice enough.
 Good for a scrud.
Thats crap!! Sister Brown Bird.  Good going. 
Hi there!
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
That word was swans.
No.
Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttles Private Very Special Spacecamp!! 
Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
Oh no! An asteroid! 
Wow.
Noo, thats our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Good luck.
 Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.

Op.
Oh, you got me.
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
 Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Its not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Yes?!
  Do you want my pickle?
 The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hi! So Im out having lunch at Monicas and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer atBloomingdalesand there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and hes gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
I know!
Uh-huh!
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
What!?
To be nice.
I didnt have to, because I was wearing my I heart Ross sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.
I mean thats unbelievable.
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Thats all right.
Hey. 
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Oh.  Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Music. Very nice.
So, how are you?
Oh yeah, whats it about?
Yeah, I do. 
I cant believe Mark didnt call. Its Sunday night, and he didnt call.
 Yeah, right. Look at you, youre practically giddy.
Yeah, and you dont mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
 Hello, Mark? Hi, its Rachel Green.  Oh no, dont you apologize.  Yeah, Ill hold.  He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
 Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, its perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye!  I got the interview!
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
I got to figure out what Im going to wear.
Yeah! Right! Okay, Ill see you guys later.  Woo hoo!
 Hey!
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Hi.
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
Me too!
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Hi Mark!
Oh, I did!
 Oh my God!! 
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Honey, Im sorry.
 It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Why?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Hmm? Oh, yeah. 
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do?
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
 Hi, is Rachel there?
This is Ross?
Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Okay.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
What?
Okay, bye-bye. 
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. 
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
I mean my God...
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
I would never do that!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
What am I going to do?
I don't know you guys.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!  Hi Rach. 
 Hi.
 I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Yeah.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Ahh, no.
Are you jealous?
You are totally jealous.
Honey, I love you too.
What?
Huh.
Six? I just had it for one night. Its three.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, youre gonna have to help me out here, cause I only have three.
Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!
Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey, thanks.
Right.
What?
 Thats because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and its static cling. Or maybe its just that God knew Id be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Its good to see you too.
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
Yeah.
Me too.
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
No, I just I think that its too soon.
 Morning.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Tomorrow night.
Its not a date, okay. Im just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Were not gonna have sex! Okay, nothings changed here. He still doesnt want children and I still do, so thats why were just gonna be friends.
You say Thank you very much, and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, were gonna put are hands in this bowl, and were gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
You touch peoples eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Oops.
Gotta keep squishing.
Okay.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm, be.....
Umm, youve got some on your pants.
So, howd the lasagne go over?  Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things.  Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.  I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing.  Its a word!
Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure.
Ill call you back. 
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Oh.
No!  No!
Cause if you do that means youd be cancelling it for me, and were just friends.
Hi.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs,  in a grill fire.
What are you smiling at?
Yeah, right.
I love this friend thing!
Ow!
Oh my God! Oh my God! 
 So um, who was she?
 Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
 Okay, y'know what, Im not fine, Im not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom....  Y'know what, what if were friends who dont see other people?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Thats not true, you dont have a moustache.
Y'know what, Ive got to walk out of here right now, cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I dont think I could do it again.
How bout one last game of racquetball?
Watch the thorns!
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
 Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
Hey Leslie, howd you know Id be here?
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Hmm, bummer.
No. But thanks.
Okay. No. But thanks.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,nothingcan penetrate this icy exterior.  Can I have a tissue, please?
Wheres Chandler?
Oh. 
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. Thats the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Youneverrun on a barge!
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
You think you know me so well.
Yeah.
Thats what I said.
I cant. I cant. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
 I stepped in something icky.
 Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault.
Oh, yeah!
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up. 
 Oh, I thought you werent coming. What? Where were you?
Okay, dont give me a reason to get mad, okay
No, look, I told you that I didnt want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably wouldve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I cant trust you then just forget it.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we wont be partners. So whats it gonna be?
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-lifes gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Okay.  Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell. Thats all I have so far.

Nobody likes change.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Im sorry, okay, Im sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Look, Im not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen!
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?
 Yes I would.
 Yes.
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because its, I mean its you.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what youre thinking?
Order a pizza like, I forgive you?
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because Im kinda hungry myself.
No anchovies.
Thats okay, Ill just pick em off.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
What, now youre not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-Im sorry, okay, Im sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought Id lost you, I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I dont cheat right, I, thats not me, Im not Joey!
Y'know what, y'know what, Im-Im not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. Youre the one that bailed on us. Youre the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Thats what?!
Okay, well here we are. Now were in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And Im sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I cant.  I just cant see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Okay, okay, okay.
What?
 Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together...
Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.  Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
 Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.

Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Ah!  Oh.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Yeah, well.
Oh yeah, Id love that.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. 
....right? Right? I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I dont, I dont need them, huh, Ive got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.

We were on a break!
Hey-hey, its valid okay? And Im not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Thats what you said last night.
Okay.
Obviously not to Joey.
 Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
I can.
Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, Im, you, you planned this all out, and I dont want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
No, no, really, Ive got to take the car back anyway, Im spending all day tomorrow with Ben, Its fine, no guilt I promise.
Okay.
Okay.
That would be great.
I know!
 Hi! Sorry Im late. Were you sleeping?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay.
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
 So Im gonna take off then!
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Oh my God!!
Frank! Hi!
What are you doing here?
What happened?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Your getting married?!
My little brothers getting married!!
Do I?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Yeah, isnt it fantastic?
What, hes 18.
Yeah, Im a big surprise.
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure youre ready for that?
Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
No, I know, I know, that this is Franks life,  y'know. Y'know, I dont want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!
No-no, oh, Im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat!
But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics.
Yes. Not out loud.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then hes gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I cant.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. 
 Youre Franks best man?!
Well then,  what about you?! Huh?!
Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Y'know what, forget it. Its ruined.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
What umm, what happened?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Yeah, yeah, no, I dont, I dont know. But, y'know what, maybe its just all for the best?
Oh, sweetie, oh. 
Uh, well I can tell you why. Its, its because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. And youre gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Okay.
Okay, but.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didnt. Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Yeah, but not just that.
None the less.
Thats right, exactly.  All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good.  Bye-bye.  Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong.  Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse?  Okay, all right, good. .
Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Still?!
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
 Hello.

Getting it away from me would be job one.
You need to get some sleep.
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Hmm?
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.

Nope.

Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um,Return Of The Jedi?

 Hey!
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Okay.
Hi.
Guess what?
They published my paper.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Noo!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Nooo!

I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. 
Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what its like to be you?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when were on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like somebodys ripping out my heart!

But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.
 Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.

Vince is a fireman.
Okay.

Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't.
That is so great! Oh, I...  Oh my God!
 Oh my God!!!
 No! No!
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.  Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? 
 and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
 Uh.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's soooveryburly. 
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Yeah.
Jason is not a sissy!
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive its just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt.   Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Wow! I didnt know you guys actually used those.
Umm, wow. This-this isnt gonna be easy. Umm, I dont think we should see each other anymore.

 Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?  So Its really just about the math.
 Jason?

Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Thank you!
It was, it was her voice.
Yay!
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
You're not going to go.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
No, but, your-your mad.
No.
Your not going.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
No, because your not upset.
About the yelling.
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
We're good.
Okay. Honey?
I love you. 
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
What?
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. 
You will?!
Well, yeah.
 How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
 Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
So we're a little late.

Awwww!!!
Wow! What a pleasure.
Hey.

Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
What is this? Fruit?
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
This will just be my batch.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
 You talked to him. Are you crazy?
 Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean 
Aww.  Ohh!
Put your hands together.
No more jam?!
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Let me see.  Oh, right.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Hey.
Where you going?
Sperm or regular?
So you're really doing this, huh?
Sounds nice.
No kiddin', hmm.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
He's got the body for it.
You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Yeah!
Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Oh Monica.  Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool,  for like a day. .
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.
 Did I get it?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Hey, man. What's up?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Is anybody else scared?
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
 Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Noo.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
You think?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. 
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
It doesn't scare me!
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. 
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
She said she'd call me.
Oh God.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
 Hello, Janice.
 Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
 No. Not anymore.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. 
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Here in Chelsea.
A woman's
 Chelsea.
Can I be that guy?
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
 Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay, what do I do?
Hello!

You want some help with that?
Whoa! Are you okay?
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
This place is really my Grandmothers.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
 Okay, heres your penis!
So?!
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.

Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Ugh, museum.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Yeah, if youre really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
Its not a library...
So, Dr. Green, hows the old boat.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Wow. Im sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. 
Okay! 
Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad mustve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Thats Daddy?! But doesnt it bother you? Youre a waitress.
So?
You really serve people sneezers?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Oh, ah, you dont need that.
The carbon, its messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, its a sickness really.
I know.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!

Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Excellent!
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Every year.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the Geller Bowl.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kindve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Rosss nose.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
 I won the game.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, its been twelve years.
 Once!!
Okay. Lets bring it in.
Well, why dont we just bunny up.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Phoebe.
All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Huddle up.
Okay.
Okay, Phoebe you know what youre doing right?
Okay, Joeys gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what youre doing?
Break.
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Losers walk!
Come on guys! Lets go! Come on, its second down.
No its not, its second.
Wow, what?
Pulling what? Its second down.
I heard that!
All right, come on guys, lets go! Tie score, and were runnin out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! 
Run, Phoebe, run!
After the snap!
Does so count!
Y'know what, thats fine, maybe you havent grown up, but I have.
Dead leg!! 
No! Listen, Im not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you cant blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Lets just call this, tie score and its halftime.
Y'know what? Ill think youll play.
Because the winner gets this!
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!
Come on Phoebe, lets go! Come on, its time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, Ill take care of the rest.
Break!
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya dont see that everyday, do ya?
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were winning because Im better than you.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, Ill prove it to you, okay. Ill trade you Joey for Rachel, and Ill still win the game.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Come on Rach, come on. Lets see whats it like to be on a winning team for a change.
All right then.
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while youre making out...
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Lets kill um!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down by two points. Two points....  Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Honey, theres a reason.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, Ill pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
No! Im not okay!
Come on! Come on! Hurry! Were running out of time! Huddle up!
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Break!
Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!
Ow!!
Let go!
No!
I dont know. I guess the other people just dont care enough.
Let go!
