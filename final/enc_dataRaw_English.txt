 I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
 No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
 Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
 Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
 OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?  I'm still gonna go.
 Fun Bobby is so great.
 Half full oflooooovvvvve.
 We went through alotof wine tonight, you guys. 
  Ooooooh.
 Monica, have you ever been with him when hewasn'tdrinking?
 Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
 Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
 Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. 
 Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
 Yeah, OK.
 OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
 Hey.
 Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
 Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
 Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not reallyanythingat him anymore.
 What's the matter?
 What, isn't he sober?
 Ohhh, OK.
 Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
 I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
 Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
 It's not that bad.
 Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
 I, OK....
 Periodontist.
 Bye.
 What do you mean?
 Can I get you something from the bar?
 If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
 So the light went out in my refrigerator...
 Hey.
 Where ya goin'?
 What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
 Oh God, even his knock is boring.
 Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
 This is really hard for me to say.
 Oh, no, no, it's about you.
 I think you may have a drinking problem.
 Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
 Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
 OK.
 What happened?
 Awwwwwwww.
 So how did everything go?
 Well, we've gotta go.
 Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
 The other us.
 We're uh, we're getting married.
 Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
 Look I just thought that...
 Is your finger caught in that chair?
 Want us to go?
 Uh-huh.
 They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
 Are you really not going?
 They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
 Ross, I thought you were over this.
 That's great!
 For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
 That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
 Oh, yeah.
 Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
 Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
 Ok, who ordered what?
 Oh hello, Ross.
 Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
All right, you!
 Fine, whatever.
 Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
 You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
 My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
 I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
 And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
 You do?
 Of course I do.
 Thank you.
 Would you look at them?
 How you doin'?
 You did a good thing today.
 You wanna dance?
 Come on. I'll let you lead.
 Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
 Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
 Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
 Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
 Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
 Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. 
 Never mind, it's open.
 Let's get out of here.
 OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
 Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
 I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
 Yeah.
 And she's not crazy?
 Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
 Excellent!
 Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
 And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. 
 This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
 Woah.
 I hate actors.
 Excuse me.
 Uh, is your name Chandler?
 Chandler Bing?
 I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
 It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
 Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
 You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
 OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
 Oh that's me, I gotta go.
 Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
 I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
 Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
 Stick a fork what?
 Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
 Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
 OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
 What did you say?
 Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
 But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
 Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
 Could ya?
 How you doin there squirmy?
 How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
 I want you right here, right now.
 Meet me in the bathroom. 
 C'mon.
 Alright mister, let's see those panties.
 Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
 If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
 Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
 C'mon hurry, hurry.
 Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
 Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
 This is for the fourth grade.
 Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
 My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
 Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. 
 I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves 
 Ma?
 Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
 Are you naked in there?
 Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
 Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
 Well, let me see.
 What? Let me see. 
 Hi Tushie.
 Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
 Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
 Hi.
 Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
 Well, this all looks good.
 And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
 Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
 No, just a salad will be fine.
 Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
 Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
 Don't, I like it dirty.
 So, uh, what are you going to do next?
 Are they, uh, firm?
 You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
 You gonna slice them up real nice?
 Aaaahhhhhhh.
 Hey, you feelin' better?
 So, do you have any other possibilities?
 Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
 No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
 Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
 Hi darling.
 Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
 Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
 Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. 
 Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
 C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
 Why?
 There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. 
 Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
 Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
  Hey, Mon, what is this?
  Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
 OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
 Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
 Some girl ate Monica.
 Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
 Ahh, so do you, beautiful. 
 What?
 Everybody smile.
 It is off.
 Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
 He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. 
 I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
 The button, the button.
 Dance with him.
 I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
 Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
 Hey you.
 So, uh, how was your day?
 Hey cool, mine too.
 OK. 
 C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
 Monica.
 Honey, I'm just checking.
 Monica.
 Monica.
 Mon.
 I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
 Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
 OK. 
 I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
 Just one cheek.
 Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
 C'mon touch it.
 Oh, come on squeeze it.
 Rub it.
 What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
 So how'd it go?
 She laughed at you?
 Hey.
 OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
 Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
 Hi you guys.
 Hey.
 Goodnight.
 Stop sending food to our apartment.
 You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
 No one.
 Nothing.
 Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
 It's Richard Burke.
 Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
 Oh God, absolutely.
 I know.
 Well maybe he was nervous.
 It's OK, it's fine.
 Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
 Oh.
 Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
 No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
 We won't?
 What is this? What are we doing?
 Grape.
 Oh, God.
 Ah, so what are we looking at?
 Really?
 Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. 
 Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
 Oh, thank God.
 Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
 What?
 Waaa-aaah.
 The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
 Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  You used my toothbrush?
 Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
 Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
 Hey.
 Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
 Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
 Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
 Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
 She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. 
 I know, this is a great apartment.
 Hey.
 Thanks. You want it?
 Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
 C'mon, it's my birthday.
 Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
 Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
 What?
 Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
 Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
 Well then maybe you should take it.
 Fine with me.
 Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
 Hey.
 Yeah me too.
 Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
 So I got ya something. 
 Lick away my man.
 What?
 No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
 Well I didn't think that was serious.  Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
 Well, there you go.
 Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
 I did pay for half of it.
 Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
 Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
 Hey, save us some pizza. 
 Stop talkin' to your men. 
 Congratulations. 
 Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
 So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
 Thanks.
 Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
 Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
 No.
 Art.
 That's right, I have a phonein here.
 Yeah.
 I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. 
 Calm down, I'm blow drying.
 What's goin' on?
 Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
  All yours.
  I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
  Shut up.
 See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
 You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
 No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah.  Oh, were you takin' a nap?
 Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.  Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks.  Call Joanna.  Hi.
 Did you see me write one down?
 Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
 Look, you wanna get off my back?
 Wait hold on Tony, hold on.  Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on.  Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
 OK.
 Yeah, yeah he is. 
 Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
 Would you guys stop.
 Wha-, oh, quit it.
 Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
 Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. 
 Well, I guess we could tapeEntertainment Tonight.
 Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
 Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
 Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
 You hated me when we were kids?
 Why did you hate me?
 And that wasn't fun for you?
 I can't believe you hated me.
 Really?
 I can do that.
 So you wanna watch uh,Entertainment Tonight?
 What?
 Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
 Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
 Monica.
 You're obviously not their favorite pet.
 Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
 God that is good TV.
 No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
 Why don't you play with your roommate?
 Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
 Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
 Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
 I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. 
 That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
 That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
 Hi.
 I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
 Thanks.
 I'm Tilly.
 I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
 He's kind of intense huh?
  A little what?
 Bye-bye.
 Bye.
 Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
 That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
 Where's Buddy?
 My fish, Buddy.
 Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
 Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
 Why?
 Why would you kill his fish?
 Alright.
 Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
 Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
 Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
 No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
 No, that means nothin to me.
 Pecan sandy, just made em.
 Uh, sure, why not.
 I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
 What's you point man?
 I heard that.
 Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
 A mirror?
 Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
 Cache? Jaunty?
 Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
 Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
 Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
 Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition forAnother World.
 You're welcome.
 Things change, roll with em.
 Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
 You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
 I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
 What, what's that?
 Open it, open in.
 Woah.
 Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
 What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
 Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab onAnother World.
 That audition.
 Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
 So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
 Toilet paper?
 Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
 I am your friend.
 But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
 Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
 Huh, I'm just saying...
 Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
 Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
 That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
 Lemonade? You ok man?
 Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
 That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
 No help required Chico. 
 Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
 Five oh dollars.
 That's great.
 Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
 One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
  Oh my God, what's goin' on?
 No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
 Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
 Great, how did it go?
 Good for you.
 You're livin' the dream.
 All right then.
 What?
 Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
 I'll take it. My gift to you man.
 I, I'm sorry, I uh  I already have a roommate. 
 Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
 Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
 See ya.  Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
 Welcome home man. 
 Absolutely.
 Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
 I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
 What?
 C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
 Ooh, you almost had it.
  Hello
 Hi honey.
 What?
 You can watch our tape if you want.
 Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
 Great. That would be fine.
 Oh shout, that would have been fun.
 Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
 Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
 We love you. Buy.
 Ross.
 How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
 Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
 Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
 With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
 Thank you.
 No luck huh?
 Oh, yeah sure, Ok. 
 Uh, I'm holding Ben.
 Ok.
 This is how I would hold a football.
 Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
 Really?
 What?
 You think about stuff like that?
 Two, two babies?
 Then what's gonna happen?
 Uh-huh.
 Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
 Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
 I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
 Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
 Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
 What was the book?
 Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
 But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
 Thank you.
 I didn't know that.
 Fine, I will.
 Oh yeah.
 Well I love you too.
 Yes it is.
 Yeah, well they suck too.
 Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
 It's us.
 I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
 Ben just said hi.
 Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
 What did he say?
 We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
 Tuesday.
 Take care.
 We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Really.
 On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
 Ahh.
 His indian name?
 Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
 Why?
 See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
 Yeah good luck, good luck.
 No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
 Run Phoebe run.
 Are you kidding me?
 Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
 Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
 What's the matter?
 Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
 Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
 That is so not my motto.
 Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
 Oh, thank God.
 Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
 Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
  It's a woman.
 Nobody does honey.
 Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
 What are these, stitches?
 Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
 How do you know Frank?
 Yeah. What? 
 He went out for groceries.
 Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
 Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
 Heavy.
 No but he didn't really talk about anything.
 Except stilts.
 Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
 Yeah.
 Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
 This is huge, you can buy me beer.
 I gotta friend named Mark.
 Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
 Alright.
 Ok, yeah.
 Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
 He-he-he, how's it goin'?
 Ohhh.
 Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
 Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
 Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
 I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
 Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
 Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
 Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
 Why her mom?
 Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
 Excuse me?
 Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
 What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
 Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
 Hi Monica.
 Well, my goodness, what was that?
  Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. 
  Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-,  oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
 Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
 Alright you guys are off to party number one  and you, you are off to party number two  Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
 All right.
 What?
 Why.
 Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
 I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
 I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
 All righty roo.  What a great moment to say that for the first time. 
 Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
 Everything you've heard is true.
 Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
  Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
 Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
 I, I know. 
 Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
 I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
 Oh, you kids  Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
 Thank you.
 Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
 Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
 Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
 No.
 Ok, you can have it. 
  Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
 So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
 Yeah, I've had it.
 Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out.  Oh look!
 Monica...  Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
 What're you doing?
 Are you remaking the bed?
 Then, you're redoing it because...
 You're pretty much running that risk either way.
 Oh, well that's not so crazy.
 Oh, alright.
 Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
 Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
 I, I, I'm hideous.
 Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
 You're strict.
 You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
 If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
 Thank you.
 You're gonna do what to my clocks.
 Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
 Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
 No come on. Come on tell me.
 Come on.
 No that's not true. That is not true.
 Yeah.
 Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
 Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
 Monica, wake up. Monica.
 I thought of a thing.
 Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
 Or so I would have you believe.
 Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
 Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
 What, forget it!
  Oh my God, you look so good!
 So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
 Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. 
 Get out!
 Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
 Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
 Joey, no means no!
 Hey, there.
 Are you all right?
 Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
 All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
 Okay, good luck 
 I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
 Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
 Rachel!
 Stay well.
  Rach! Rach!
 Oh my God, I'm married!
 I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
  Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
 Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
 ...from the syphilis.
 What,  you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.  Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
  Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
 Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
 Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.   What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers.
 And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
 Marenge,
 Everybody!
 Where is she, Where is she?  Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Man, I sure miss Julie.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
 Bob here.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. 
I know.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Great, I'll see you then.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
 Hi, Julie.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know, like from, like 20?
Do we need a cake?
Yeah, whoosh! 
Yeah, you're right.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.   Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Go.
Hi.
Yes?
How did you...
Thanks.
What are these, like famous chickens?
 Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Anything else?
 Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Yeah.
I hear ya.
That's a good point.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
All of us.
Yeah.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Come on.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Fine.
Chandler!
Geez! Are you ready?
Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow!
Still doing the screening thing?
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Oh, hi.
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. 
Eh.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
 Bumpy?
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Excellent, that was excellent.
 Ross.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Oh great, it's work.  Can you hand me that? 
 Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Oh!
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
There's my little boy. 
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
 Here you go. 
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Consider it done.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat...as needed.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
No, seriously.
And who is this little cutie pie?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Okay.  All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!  Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Hey, hey, look at that talent. 
 Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
 Ben!
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords. 
He's here.  I'm assuming one of you is the father.
I'm him.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Yeah.
Ahh!
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
You got a better idea?
Heads.
Yes! Whew!
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy.  Hey, he's not crying.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the busHey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
 Will you hold Ben for a sec?  Come here. Come here.
 Okay, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellent. . . about me?
  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
 Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
  Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
 Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
 But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .
 So you really Okay about all this?
 Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
 Uh huh.
 Yep.
 Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
 Hopefully.
 I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
  I'm sorry?
 Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
 Um, cheers.
 Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
 Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
 Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
 All right.
 You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. 
 Fruit flies?
 No! No dessert, just a check, please.
 No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movieDinerin my head.
 Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
 Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
 Hang on.
 What.
 I'm talkin'!
 All right, fine.  I'll call you back. 
 Good.
  Hey Rach.
 Oh. And how was the date?
 Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
 Okay. Oh, oh, oh. 
 No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
 Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
 Rach, I got a message from you.  Who's Michael?
 You're over me?
 Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
 When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
 You've had feelings for me?
 Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
 Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
 China.
 Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. Okay, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. Okay so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
  I'll be right down.
 Well, Okay, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
 This man is my God.
 I didn't get a cat.
 No, no it's not interesting. Okay, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
 You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
 I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
 Then you should have said something before I met her.
 There was never a good time.
 Not, not, notevery night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiancs or, or, or Italian guys.
 The point is I... I don't need this right now, Okay. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
 Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
 Fine.
 Good.
 Good. 
 Ohhhh.
 Tongue?
 No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... 
 Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
 Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
 We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
  Hey, you.
 Good. How are you?
 Hi, honey.
 Good.
 Oh, well, actually.
 What?
 No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
 Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
 Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
 You could say that.
 Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
 Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
  Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
 Hey, do you guys have......hi.
  Where you goin'?
  Oh.
 Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
 Really?
 Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
 Let me get my coat.
 Well what is it? Let me see.
 Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
 And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
  Alright.  "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
 All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
 Good luck.
 Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
 Just a waitress?
 Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
 She is notRachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
 Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
  When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
 Not interested.
  Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
  Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
 What are you doing out there?
 Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
 No.
 No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
  No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
 Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don't go!
 Hello?
  Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
 Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
 Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
 Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
 Hey. Hi Phoebe.
 Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
 Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
 Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
 How have you never been on Oprah?
 Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
 Hi, Phoe.
 Oh, just updating the phonebook.
  Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
 Oh, sure, yeah.  This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
 Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
 Look, I. . .
 Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
 It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
 Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
 Honey.
 Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this.  This is the real him.
 Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. 
 Hey.
 C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
 Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
 I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
 He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
 Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Yeah, big stuff.
 OK.
 OK.  Brake left, gas right?
  Where's my seat belt?
 Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
 Oh, so that's what this is for.
 Sure is.
 Good luck Phoebs.
 Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
 How far'd ya get?
 Alright, we're gettin' closer.
 Phoebs, what's goin' on?
 Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
 Well, so why not go knock?
 Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
 Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
 Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
 Are you OK?
 OK, Phoebs, your turn.
 Uh-huh.
So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. 
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
You broke a little girls leg?!!
 Says here that a muppet got whacked onSeasame Streetlast night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Im gonna get back to retraining. 
Its all right. Sweetheart.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in arealspace shuttle.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
So far, Ive sold seventy-five.
Five dollars a box.
A ten speed bike. But, Id rather have something my Dad couldnt sell.
Could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?
 Yesss?
Youre no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
What does that mean?
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
Im pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I can still see you!
 Hey! Hey!! 
All right, Ill take a box of the cream filled Jesuss.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
No, but ah, theres coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, Ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
All right, Ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and thats it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
No.
Dont, dont, dont, dont, dont do this.
 Oh God! I gotta go! 
 Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
What?
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-its no big deal, all right, Im-Im cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
So, how many have you sold so far?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
 Okay, stop what youre doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Me! On my computer.
I dont know, I dont know, werent you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
And now for the great news.
Oh.

Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
I cant! Its too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  Look at her, shes even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
 Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, cause this parts tricky, see some people use filters just once.
Really Mr. Geller, you dont have to do this.
Im an alien. Im an alien.
Real magic does exist.
Ah, somebodys at the door on the ceiling.
All right, be my guest.
 Hows that coffee comin, dear?
Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?
Eh.
Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential. Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Come on over here, sweetheart. 
 I need these hangers separated ASAP.  Youre welcome.
I know honey, Im sorry.
 Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt.... I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... 
Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Ah, just one other thing.
I ah, I work atBloomingdalesand I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Yeah,Jell-ojust like Mom used to make.
Hi!
Wow!
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
And hes, hes a total stranger?
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Well, Im just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
 So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?
How can you not know which one?
Which one is Gina?
Thats okay.
Hey, Joey.
Yep, Im in a tree.
No honey, Im sorry, but the weekends not over yet.
I guess theyre back from their date.
Oh my God!
I am good. I finished my book.
I dont remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Hey, Chandler!
Bummer.
 What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Thats right good things, that-that is what I said. 
That is so made up!
There you go.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, Id expect nothing less.
High collar and baggy pants say Im a pro.
What?! 
Hi!
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... 
Hi. 
Howd did it go?
Im so proud of you.
Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so...
Yeah.
Rachel?
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Yes.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
 Tell him.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
 Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
It is me! It's a musical version ofTale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna singNew York, New York, and ah, ohI left My Heart in San Francisco.
What?
Here, let me.  Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
And who may I say is calling?
Ross of.....
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Hey, hold on a second.
Hi honey!
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.  Mark, I need you!
Ow! Ross!!
Wh-what's that?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
You're hurt!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Mark's a genius!
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
What is going on?
 Ross!
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! 
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
A big idiot.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. 
Where ya going?
Ohh, with who?
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!
Man, I gotta get a kid. 
Sure, is she married?
Oh. 
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
What?
Six dollars, please.
Eight oclock is the cut-off and,  aww, its 8:02.
 I can help with that.
Hi!
So, you look great.
No you do. You... just...
Youve got panties stuck to your leg.
Its good to see you.
Its good to see you too.
Hes gonna go up to the counter withCitizen Kane,Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy.  This is nice.
I missed this.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
Cool.
Somebody got in late last night.
When did this happen?
So, are you gonna see him again?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now shes celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know youll probably be hungry after the sex.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Ew, this feels very weird.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them.  Thats my hand.
Okay.
Tomatoes are squishing.
Op.
Yeah.
What?
Sure.
So, howd the lasagne go over?  Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things.  Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too.  I know. Its hard this whole platonic thing.  Its a word!
You really sure?
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Just your dad.  Although thats actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sisters neighbour next Tuesday.
You want me to cancel it?
Okay.
Got em.
 Sorry. Im sorry.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs,  in a grill fire.
Im sorry, I was just thinking youre day could still pick up.
Hello.
  Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening. 
Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Well, you seem fine.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Wow. Y'know were back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothings changed.
Okay, okay, one things changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
I know I couldnt. So....
How bout one last game of racquetball?
Wow! This girl is good.
I like her.
 beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way.
Hey Phoebe.
 So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Yeah, but, I dont do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldnt come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
 Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Someone in here.
Yeah, you bet.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
Well, dont cha wanna?
Okay, well I do know you.
Well so?
 My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Dont care what people say. My feets best friends, pals to the end. With them Im one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Oh. 
Wow, thats great.
Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry.
Ah well, its nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, Ill see you later. Okay. 
Come here, come here.  Okay, dont get mad, okay.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
No, no, I dont want to forget it.
Yeah. You okay?
Wed love too.
Oh thats my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat.  Shes fancy.
Hey, honey.
Hey, whats going on?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this with you.
 Hi!
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. Thats it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Okay, you dont have to stop, Im invisible, Im not here. 
Yeah!!
 Pepper?
Okay sorry, whew.
 Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Im sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?
What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
Yeah, but wait...
Hey.
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
No, but itd be nice if you realised, its just a job!
Yes.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.
Is this about Mark?
Okay, its not, its not.
Oh Im, Im making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Okay, okay, fine, youre right. Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yogart, or something.. 
That would be great. Thank you.
Oh, hi. Its Mark.
What? Is it my breath?
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isnt tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Rach, are you okay?
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
All right, all right, Im coming over, and Im bringing Chinese food.
Its for me.
Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
Wow. Im sorry. Eggroll?
Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.
Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.
Hi! Its me.
Whos that?
Is that Mark?
What? Are you married? Cause thats okay.
 Previously on Friends.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?
 Oh my God.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I dont want to take a break.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Nobody.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
 Hi, its me. Ive been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Eh, Im just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I dont want to get back together over a machine.
So, I love you.
And y'know what, Im gonna, Im gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, Im gonna stop by around 8:30.
Bye.
 Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
But my apartment is so...
Wait! Wheres my shoes?
Do I know why were rushing?
Thats so great for you guys!
You must be so happy!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can, very much.
Yeah. We figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?
 The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!
Now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
Is this about me taking your watch?
Im sorry, I do that.
Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You dog!
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. Were the same, you and me.
Yeah, we are.
Yeah, we are.
Okay, were not.
But, we are.
I can promise not to tell her again.
Uh-huh.
You did a bad thing!
Very bad!
Very, very bad.
No.
All right.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
 Whos your roommate?
Thats right.
 What, what are they talking about?
Just get away from me!
 Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Just get out! Now!!
Uh-oh.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, lets talk about it!! How was she?
She was nothing compared to you.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
We were on a break!
You think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Yeah, well be fine.
Hi, its Phoebe. Listen someones gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, cause its like 9:15 now, and Im not there.
All right. Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Ohhhhh!
Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza.
Becausethatwould be crazy?
Fine.  Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza.
With ah, extra anchovies.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Are you actually saying these words?
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Thats....
That is neither here nor there.
No Ross!!  Dont! You cant just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesnt work that way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?
 I think you should go.
 I really think you need to go now.
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
 No. I cant, youre a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. Its just changed, everything. Forever.
Wait. Really?! Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Itll be great for next weekend.
Itll be great for next weekend. I mean,  itll be grrreat.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachels sisters cabin. 
Were really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Noo! Ill stay. Hes my brother.
No! Were gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
 Hi!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Hes sleeping.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary.
Its not that kind of anniversary.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh, great! Me too.
Well its very unsettling.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
  Ross, thank God.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
Yes, please.
  Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
 Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something.  What?   You slept with someone else?!
You slept with another woman?
What is he doing here?!
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Its horrible.
Why would you even want to come Ross? Youre a horrible skier.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually its the ah, middle part of my first name.
All right, lets go!
Oh, Im sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Y'know Ross why dont you putthaton your answering machine!
 I dont know.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joeys the one who agreed with you!
No, I think its very obvious whos wrong here.
 What?
Yeah.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Whos going with who?
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
All right, well call you when we get back.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Or, or the rodeo!!
I was being Shelly Winters fromThe Poseidon Adventure.
 Ugh.  Ross!
Ahh, nooo!!
Youre a genius, Ross.
Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow. 
Okay, bye!!
Yeah, okay, bye. 
Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
 Hi!
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, well y'know, I wouldve called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldnt find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Well, we got into a fight cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
Wow!
Oh, I knew youd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Do you?
Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young to get married?
Y'know it-its funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Oh my God!! Great!
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference between us.
Ho-ho, I will.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and then youre gonna hate yourself.
No-no-no-no-no. 
No.
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! 
I couldnt help it, there love is so pure.
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Absolutely. Okay, first well start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesnt work we can go back to
Oh no-no, never say that. If we cant get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
 Hi.  Wait, no! Just put the mail down. Its-its me!
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought Id curl up in it. Is that all right?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since Ive been alive.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I dont see how I could all of the sudden be too young, cause Im older than I was when we first got together.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, its still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now its, and now its gone and I dont know why!
What?
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didnt want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. 
Phoebes right Frank. I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.  Is that it, is that what it is?
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want. 
We were out ofDoritos.
Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes so funny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!
 Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! 
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me.
Hey!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.
 If I broke up with you, Id miss you.
Hi!
Yeah. Ahh, heres a box of your stuff. 
Oh, y'know, its just like hats, and a shirt, and CDs, just sort of stuff that youve left here.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know its time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean dont you think?
Yeah?
Good.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! Ill keep the mug.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Petty... 
Petty...
Small...
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Huh?
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesnt even fit you anymore!
 yeah-yeah-yeah!!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
You didnt just break up.
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Okay.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Stop what?!
No!! You cant!!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!
Look man!
Listen to me!! 
Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole,youare going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? Its over.
Okay.
Huh. 
Hi Monica!
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
No, it's been three nights in a row.
It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this?
God, what is wrong with me.
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
 Honey, I was wondering....
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Hmm.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Well honey, what about you?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Come on you gotta have one!
Ross, you know what...
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Yeah.
Oooh!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Hi you guys!
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
I know I do.
Hi.
What?
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Were both of those Joey?
Not even with your best friend.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Pretty much.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. 
Umm, yeah.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Okay.
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
I know!
Okay.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
You said...
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
The little ones do.
Morning.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! 
Hi, oh, Im Lauren, Kates understudy.
I know! I-Im a big fan of yours.
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray onDays of Our Lives.
Absolutely!
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
 Oh, youre so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Cool! I-Ill see you then.
Dont spoil it.
 Hello. Oh! Its you. Just ah, just one-one sec.  I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call,committing to the moment! 
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater youre dating.
I dont care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you?
 Okay, Im afraid to say this, but lets pick it up where we left off.
I cant believe we go on in, in a week.
 Hey! So since were getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, okay.
Ill see you tomorrow. 
Gnight. 
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Well, Adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor cant just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Yeah, thats pretty much what I had in mind.
Hi.
Hi.
Its a little early to be drinkin.
Youre kidding?! Thats great!
Oh my.
Oh, fire! There, theres a fire! Fire!!
Hi.
About what?
Nooo. And theres really no reason he should find out, so ah lets not make a big deal about it, okay?

How do you do.  Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  Did they have representation?
 Here we go people!  Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Kate Millers awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.  Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is  Thank you, boys and girls, youve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mothers crab cakes!  Excuse me!!
Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Fabulous.

Of course I do.
I dont know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy Why cant I just pick someone like you?
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, youre just so, youre so, so 
No, no, Im fine, and yknow why? Cause of all the riboflavin.
Hey! Didnt you have that outfit on last night?
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?

Whoa!
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
No, no?
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?

Yo!! 
So, whats up?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
No-no its okay. Its just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and  That theres so much in me I have to share with you yet.
 Im sorry, I cant talk. Im gonna go write in my journal. 
 Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.

You didnt break up with that fireman?
Wow!
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?  So Its really just about the math.
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
My parents will be so happy.
 Hey. I was
 Whoa! Hey-hey! Whats going on here? Who is this guy?
What?!
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
You have?
 I-I cant believe this! You-youve slept with him?!
Y'know Phoebe, Im gonna make this real easy for you. 
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign, and it says Youre in Sample. 
Tell us!
Keep on scooching.
What happened?
Why is this happening to me?! I dont know, maybe its my wound.
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
No-no-no oh, keep your name, dont take his name.
Well thendefinatelydont take his name.
Why?! What is it?
 Oh?!
Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyreareno rules.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.
Yeah. What are we getting?
Its just hard when I know I have e-mailI cant get!
All right, on the table. 
Oh, believe me, I dont want to get hurt either. Im being smart about this. See these guys? Theyre the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
I promise.
Yeah.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
 Hey!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! Hes known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! Hes a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck!
What, look back?
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well Im not gonna stop until Im the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dads garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Look, Im gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Hey! How long until Petes fight?
Hot dog?
Its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution. Ah, Im not supposed to move my spine.
Im fine! Id fight tonight, if theyd let me.  See this circle Im marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
I cant until Im the ultimate fighter. I will do it. Im telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, Im not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adams Apple, but that really hurt.
Well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone Im not. Ive got to do this.
Mon-Monica?
Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning!
Tell it again.  Seriously.
Oh!
Thats too bad.
Oh, I wasnt talking about his karma.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Go, go, go!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law!
Aww, thank you.
No-o-o!  No way!
Yeah well, if ah, if thats the rule this weekend...  No!
Get away!
Stay away!
 No!  No!
What?
 Totally familiar. 
Wooooo!!!!
Actually, y'know its kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I think Ill help her out.   What is going on here?
You painting his toenails?
Chasing him all around the room?
Hes totally flirting with you too.
I dont know.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Us too.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Really?!
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Yeah!
Y'know what, I should do it.
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she wont tell me.
Hi.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, thats right, thats right, it was you!
 Hey guys.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
You dont know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Y'know, hey! Youre the one who ended it, remember?
You still love me?
You still love me.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
What?!
What?
But I made cards!!
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey, mister tux!
We have a half hour.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
 Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Am I in it?
 Hello.
Whoa!
Thank you! I know, though.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
 Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Hang on a second I just got in.
We could not, would not want to wait.
 "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"  Is that too spooky?
 What?!
Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Huh?
What am I gonna do?
All right! 
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
 The sheep.
 Where's my underwear?!
He took my essence!
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Duh!! Christmas!
 Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
But I...
All right.
 Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
 Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
I'm not gonna gooo.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
It's fine.
I'm not mad.
I'm just not going.
Right.
Um, hum.
No.
Right.
Right, and the humiliating.
Um, hum.
Right.
Yes, Ross. 
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You could drink the fat.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Yaaaay!
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Let's see what else he'll do!
Noooo!!!!
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way....
I'm going commando, too.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
I didn't know there were docks.
Aww, is it broken?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Monica's making jam.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. 
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. 
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Joey, this is you!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
And that's how you bought it?
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Thank you, Monica.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Hey.
To the bank.
Sperm.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
What?
Really? Why?
Hoyt?
Really, is he a swimmer?
I like that.  What?
We do not have one of those signs.
Two girls and a boy?
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Yeah.
Oh Monica.  Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool,  for like a day. .
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
 Are you intrigued?
 Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.
Hey.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  I need a pen. 
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Hey, you know about that?!
 Where there is no fear of commitment.
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
We should?
 I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
You probably want us to move in together?
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Honey, this will help. 
That is never good.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ohh! 
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Yeah, you do.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
 No, thank you.  Chandler!
What are you doing here?
Are you being British?!
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Where is this party?
Who's party is it?
What woman?!
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? 
 That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Yes, and grumpy.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
 Hey Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?
I thought you only met him once?
Well relax, hell be here.
 What a geek!
Oh, hi.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey.
Whoa!
Whoa!!
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?

Whens your birthday?
I know a guy whos the 18th.

So hows it going with you guys?
Oh honey, were close now but you-you wouldnt believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... Thats where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
I just asked you.
No, that is what the game is.
He started mine first!
Whoa! Big octopus.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
 Wow! Thats wild! No, I had no idea.
You mean like watch?
Well, I dont think this, y'know.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!

Fine.  I dont like you!! 
Wait thats-thats, what thats not what you do?
I dont know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I dont know.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I cant believe that I screwed it up so bad.
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasnt perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesnt melt.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you cause y'know youre my sister, y'know.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
This?
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Maybe, my rulers wrong.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.
 Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Hey, Mon.
Do I ever.
No way!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
 Can I get a beer.
You betcha!
Um-mm, yeah right!
Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
 And now Ive picked it up again. 
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? 
Yes, his name is Barry, hes a doctor, thank you very much.
Thank you. So how-how bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Oh, but thats okay.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure.  Listen, can we please have lunch the next time Im in the city?
Okay!

 Hey, youre early.
Im just taking it to be re-wired.
Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh! 
 Hey!
Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
Gotcha.
Oh, you bet I am!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Oh right, right.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. Im such a jerk.
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Huh?
Its not in the apartment?  Oh no. I cant believe this is happening again.
Okay, enough with the third degree! I-Ive, I dont live here anymore.
Im sorry, I-I-I-I dont live here anymore. I-I didnt know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!

Um-hmm.
So!   Hows the library?

You know whats really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
 I know!! Its a museum! What, youre the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. 
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
 Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Okay.
Aw honey stop! Its not that bad.
Yeah. Thats Daddy.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, Id be serving him sneezers.
So. Ross, Ive bugged him about this a million times, hes not gonna change.
You kids ready?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Why not?
 What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.
Oh Daddy, no he didnt mean anything by that, he really didnt.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, Ill tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. 
You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!

No Mon,youwant to put them in concentric circles.Iwant to do this.
Yeah.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
It was soonotan accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didnt count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Anyway. Thats when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Can I see you for a second?
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wont let me cross the street.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
 Bunny!
Ross!
Okay. All right. So lets see, lets play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, well kick off.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Yeah.
Whats block?
I thought you meant in life.
Go! Go! Go!
Come on, lets go!
Mar-haaaan.
Uh, hello, its third down.
Wow!
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Okay, its second down.  Take all the second downs you need.
Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thats mean!
Pheebs, run!
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesnt count.
Oh Pheebs, thats great. It doesnt count.
Oh my God!
Oh-ho, okay.
Woo-yay!!
Okay, first of all, I dont play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Oh really! Why is that?
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
That cup is mine!
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Its hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
What are you gonna do?
Okay.
 Hi.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats with the tackling?
I went really long.
Its no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Youre so pathetic! Why cant you just accept it, were winning because Im better than you.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, thats ridiculous Monica, because Im only down by three touchdowns.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Are you gonna let me play?
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
No! Come on! Dont make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Thank you! Break!
Im so sorry! Are you okay?
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
 Okay.
Let go! Let go!
Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important who wins or loses. The important thing is,  the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in.
No! You let go!
How come its always us left in the field holding the ball?
Gimme the this!
